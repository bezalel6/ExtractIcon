ExtractIcon
===========

Simple command line utility to extract a Windows file icon as a PNG in its highest resolution. Automatically detects and extracts icons at their native sizes up to 256x256.

## Key Improvements in This Fork

**Custom size output**: Use the `-size` parameter to resize extracted icons to any dimension you need. Icons are resized using high-quality algorithms (ImageMagick if available, or bicubic interpolation as fallback).

**Xbox Game Pass support**: Automatically detects and extracts icons from Xbox Game Pass and Windows Store applications, which store their icons as PNG files rather than embedded resources.

Usage
=====

Basic usage:
```
extracticon.exe [input_file] [output_png] [-size N]
```
